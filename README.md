In this text based game, you have to choose the correct directions to win. You are given options to move, inspect the room, pickup an item (done if an item exists which it always will initially), drop an item or look at your backpack(inventory)

-Text File Descriptions-


Both text files are formatted similarly: Seperate variables are seperated with semicolon
For Item: Item name;ItemDescription; - New Lines are for different items.


For Room: Room name;Room number;Room description;index to different rooms(seperated by semicolon. Ex: N;S;E;W; == 0;1;3;5); Phrase "win" or "no win"; - New lines are for different rooms.


Item locations are scattered randomly throughout the map. Every playthrough is different!
